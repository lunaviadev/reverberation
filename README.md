# REVERBERATION
______________________________________________________________________
## Concept

Reverberation is a new and unique approach to the single-player, platformer genre. Through its clone creation mechanism, solo players are able to complete complex challenges and solve harder problems. Following the given theme of *Chain Reaction*, the player can place clones to aid them and assign commands to each clone. These commands link together and perform an overall action. Whether it be pressing buttons or unlocking doors, the player must use these clones strategically to help them advance.
Aesthetically inspired by cyberwave and synthwave, the game features neon visuals and retro-inspired music/sfx; creating an immersive and futuristic atmosphere, whilst also remaining cozy and nostalgic.
